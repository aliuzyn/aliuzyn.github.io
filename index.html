    <h1>Ash's Favorite Internet Cats</h1>
    <p>I think the heading is pretty self explanatory. This is not a ranked list, I love all these cats equally. Enjoy!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Xiaojie</h2>

    <p>Xiaojie is most commonly known for his variety of constumes, along with his very signiture tongue sticking out during photos. Check out his instagram page <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fxiaojie_cat%2F&psig=AOvVaw2O6WbWJVq5cVf65GA4x7VK&ust=1727462207215000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBcQjhxqFwoTCJiv3L-g4YgDFQAAAAAdAAAAABBE"> here</a></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Zazu</h2>
    <img src="zazu.jpg>
    <p>Unlike Xiaojie, Zazu is more commonly known for his memes rather than costumes. You may find Zazu online to be dubbed "the 1000 meter stare cat" or the "Motion cat", as well as a variety of other memes.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Francis</h2>
    <img src="francis.webp">
    <p>Francis is the first internet cat I have ever followed. He holds a dear place in my heart. He first became an internet superstar after his <a herf="https://www.instagram.com/francisandmaggie/> owner</a> posted a video comparing him to household objects that were larger than him. This is not because Francis is a tiny kitten. Francis is actually an old grandpa! His dwarfism is what actually causes him to be so tiny. As of August this year, Francis passed away, but his memory will forever live on.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Doudou</h2>
    <img src="doudou.png">
    <p>Doudou's internet rise to fame was due to his round face and doll-like behavior. In Doudou's videos, he is very relaxed, and is just very happy to be there. Doudou also has a very unique face, with a very circular jaw, it is easy to distinguish Doudou from most other cats!</p>
    <p>Check out Doudou's Instagram page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAQc9DZv3h4/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="> here!</a></p>
